When you first install the app, it tells you that you need to evaluate your mental health by speaking to a mental health professional.¬†After evaluating your mental health, you can have a conversation a virtual AI that helps you to talk about your problems. This way you can always talk about your problems whether someone is available or not. Cons There are a lot of therapy sessions available in the app but most of them are locked, and you need to have a subscription to open them. The app won‚Äôt work until you have completed your mental health evaluation. While it\u0026rsquo;s really cool to talk to the AI about your problems, but you always feel like you are talking to an AI and not a real person. Download Link For Android Click Here For iOS Click Here AI Dungeon AI Dungeon is just like what the title says. It‚Äôs a Role-Playing Game(RPG) that uses AI to handle your progress and choices inside the game.¬†Pros Excellent UI/UX design. Plenty of rich stories that are actually great. You can create your own character, you can choose its name, gender, race, class, where you start in the game(location), and you chose if your choices affect the whole game world which really makes it like a real game. Cons You can only interact with the game by writing text into a box, which can feel repetitive after a long session of gaming. You need to create an account to unlock most of the stories. The AI sometimes takes a bit to respond to your input. Download Link For Android Click Here For iOS Click Here Hopper Hooper is an AI-based application that looks for the flights and cheapest hotel rooms around the year.\nPros Excellent UI/UX design. it works by predicting the prices based on historic data. For example: you can search for a flight between any two cities and based on the historic data it displays all the cheapest months that have the lowest ticket prices. The same thing also applies to the hotel rooms. It gives a green color to the cheapest prices, and yellow for not so cheap prices, and red for high prices. Cons It\u0026rsquo;s only limited to hotels and flights and nothing else. And what I would like to see is that it supports other things like museums or restaurants based on the location that you provided. It\u0026rsquo;s also very bandwidth-heavy, so to have the best experience you need to have a good enough internet connection.
