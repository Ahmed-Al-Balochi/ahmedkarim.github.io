      <description>Intro These apps are great at what they do; I think you will find use of at least one of them.
Youper Youper is an app for people who want to talk about their mental health problems.
Pros  Excellent UI/UX design. When you first install the app, it tells you that you need to evaluate your mental health by speaking to a mental health professional.  After evaluating your mental health, you can have a conversation a virtual AI that helps you to talk about your problems.</description>
